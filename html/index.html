			<h3>December 13th</h3>
			<p>A couple minutes of downtime.  I've been travelling for the whole weekend, New York and back. Suddenly being
				back in The Mission on Saturday night, walking home with a burrito after waking up hung over in a hotel room
				in New York was sorta stunning.  The universe allows me too much freedom.</p>

			<h3>December 15th</h3>
			<p>I've spent my downtime today making scripts for my computer, because it suddenly dawned on me that I could
				use Dropbox to sync my .bash_history and .bash_profile and, consequently, paths and aliases and all kinds
				of stuff.  I set it up on my work computer and my old MBP, so now they share a bash history.  I've started
				trying to get a few scripts together to automate some of the command-line stuff I do every day, all day.
				This is good for a few reasons I think.  1 is, I do a LOT of different stuff on the command-line, and, I 
				mean, real hackers don't seem to have any problem jumping around and knowing this stuff, and maybe it'll
				become second nature for me later, but I find that I have a really hard time switching between different
				programming languages or sets of tools. The other day, another dev at my office was asking me to do some
				simple MySQL stuff, but I hadn't touched the console in forever so a lot of it was gone.  But now that I
				know how to use it, it's really powerful.  The Django shell.  Man, I underestimated that thing.  So great
				for learning how python works and quickly testing different syntaxes or object types or whatever.  For when
				json is being cranky.  Which is always.  MORE LIKE <em>NERDTAR</em>! AM I RIGHT?</p>
				
			<p>I have been thinking about how best to publish this site.  I have no ideas still, but this command-line stuff
				has been making me want to integrate that somehow, or at least use it to automate the process if it happens
				to be tedious.</p>
				
			<p>I guess what I want to do is tweak the site as much as I want, and then have it archived in its entirety to
				a subfolder somewhere that'll still be accessible.  A database element would be great, but I worry about it.
				I guess I could just have a sqllite one or something, with files that are included in the repo itself. I
				dunno.  I don't.  What am I even writing about.</p>
				
			<p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojo&feature=player_embedded">This video about the last 200
				years of human progress</a> came to my attention in a pretty timely manner considering the last post I
				made.  This guy is so into it!  And the graph is pretty compelling.</p>
				
			<p>This morning, I was listening to some stone cold motown and walking to the subway.  It was sunny and warm
				in December.  And I listened to music on my headphones, something only a couple generations have ever been
				able to do.  It felt like all of humanity had been surging, hundreds of generations behind me pushing me
				up to a stunning crescendo.  Somehow.  Even though all I was doing was getting coffee and going into work
				late.</p>
