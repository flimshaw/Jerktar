========================================================

JERKTAR is a versioned web journal.  It's gonna need some
scripts and crap to make it work.  And the early versions
are going to be super personalized, since the journal's 
code itself *is* the journal.  I like commandline stuff 
these days, so maybe that's the direction this will take.

I'm not sure.  I'm gonna write in lots of places though.
Not always on purpose, or like, to be seen.  Blogs are
pretty exhibitionistic really.  It's hard to keep a jour-
nal online and not sorta be showing off.  In the old days,
the days of superpants.com and christop.com and elly.org
(elly's still got her presence up there, as of this wri-
ting).  The web felt more like ham radio back then.  Every-
body wasn't on there yet.  It was just a few voices in the
dark.

I'm not you know, dying for the old days.  Practically no-
thing worked back then.  But it was just a different vibe.
You know?  It felt like you were stumbling on something se-
cret and precious.  Now that everybody has blogs, it's not
really the same feeling.

But the way some of those websites were laid out back in the
day was amazing.  They had the weirdest interfaces and little
javascript toys on them.  No navigation really.  Some of them
were pre-search engine.  Archive.org has some of those saved,
but not all.  And the story of how that stuff changed is kind
of a compelling one to me.  I just wish there were a way to
keep track of this medium.  Because the way data is presented
matters.

Also, this should be a good exercise in maintaining legacy code.

I am a horrible nerd.  I've spent a whole night in a new city
tweaking my bash_profile.  A little bit writing at the end
I guess.  It's not too late to be awesome.  It's never too
late.
